 # About
 With the advancement of moder technologies areas related robotics and computer vision, the real time image processing has become a major technology under consideration. So here a try has been made for a noval approach foe capturing image from various camera in real time environment and process them and mark a attendance in the system. This approach is more reliable and more easy to use whereas the traditional method is time consuming and uses paper and pen.
